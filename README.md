# CPUAnalysis
Python Program that analyzes CPU usage, temperature, and the top-running processes at any given time on the computer

# Three Step Process
We will require three steps to make this idea cohesive:
* Obtain the data (through python packages / implementations)
* Organize the data into something usable (read into either a .json or .csv file)
* Present on a graph (Visual representation, another python package)
Each one of these steps is a lot, but these are the main things to accomplish in order to make this process work
