# SysPerfAnalysis
Python Program that analyzes CPU usage, temperature, and the top-running processes at any given time on the computer

# Three Step Process
We will require three steps to make this idea cohesive:
* Obtain the data (through python packages / implementations)
* Record the data (write into either a .json or .csv file)
* Perform data analysis of system performance (Visual representation, another python package)

Each one of these steps is a lot, but these are the main things to accomplish in order to make this process work
